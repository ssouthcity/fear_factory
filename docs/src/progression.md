# Progression

## Tutorial
Small scale replica of primary gameplay loop set in the player character's house as they are about to finish some alchemical experiment. Resource nodes and structures replaced by bottles and lab equipment, the player is instructed to set up a production chain on the workbench for the final product. Trained ants are used to handle and distribute the hazardous resources used for this step. Upon completion, the relic is created in a violent reaction which destroys the player character's house.

## The Relic
Grants the player ability to perform "relic actions". Relic actions can only be performed while the relic is in the possession of the player. Capable of stowing materials in a pocket dimension which it draws from during construction.

### Relic actions
* Construction - Ability to build structures provided sufficient resources.
* Demolition - Ability to destroy structures and reclaim spent resources.
* Recruitment - Ability to convert volatile workforce into permanent recruits.
* Inventory - Ability to inspect resources stored within the relic.
* Porter manipulation

## Early game
Following the tutorial, the player visits a nearby town and recruits volunteers to assist in cleaning up their lab. Debris from the collapsed house serves as initial resources for the factory, while the recruited voulenteers are subjected to the relic and serves as the inital workforce.

After securing more resources and increasing their workforce, the player begins cultivating the relic by inserting it into various points of the production chain. The relic draws from both material and immaterial products of structures, and eventually unlocks new structures and insights to further factory expansion.

## Evolution of terminology
Terminology for the workforce evolve throughout the game to reflect the player character's fleeting humanity. Words devolve from terms for acts of kindness to indebted servitude, e.g., friend -> worker -> noviciate -> ant.

## Ending
After the relic has been cultivated through a number of stages, the ending sequence will begin. Porters and workers around the map will begin congregating around some type of end-game structure, and the player will no longer be able to utilize the relic. Subtle signs will compel the player to drag and slot the player character into the crowded structure, much like the player has been slotting the relic throughout the game. This triggeres an ending cutscene which reveales some greater piece of context for the relic before credits roll.
