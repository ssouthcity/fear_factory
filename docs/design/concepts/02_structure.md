# Structure

A structure is a placeable construct that performs a task.

## Harvester

The harvester harvests resource nodes. It has a range that it can reach and retrieves materials from the nearest node within that range. Tempo depends on the harvested node, and range is dependant on how many workers are assigned to the structure. Appearance changes depending on the resource it harvests.
